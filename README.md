# WBIR2022

This repository contains code for the submission **Deformable Image Registration uncertainty quantification using deep learning for dose accumulation in adaptive proton therapy** to the WBIR 2022 conference. As we did not obtain permission to share the training data, this code cannot be used as such. Further, the files shared here contain only the part of the codebase directly related to the submission. As the complete codebase is not solely developed by the authors of this work, it could not be shared. However, the files here contain all the implementation details necessary to reproduce the results. Any feedback is more than welcome. Upon request, we are open to share larger parts of the codebase and answer to all questions related to this work. Contact details can be found in the manuscript.
